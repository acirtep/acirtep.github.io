<p>Multipus is the word which describes me most: I have started my career in 2007 as a data warehouse tester and, along the way, I have fulfilled different roles from technical analyst to data engineer to software engineer to team lead. I enjoy working with data, being it offline or online, batch or real time.</p>



<p>I have a vast experience in both on-prem and cloud data platforms (AWS) and data management is at the core of my work: I always keep an eye on auditability, reproducibility and immutability. I am a huge supporter of the DataOps movement.</p>



<p>Hands-on is what I enjoy the most: coding, testing, code reviews and documentation. I like to learn new technologies and I am able to use them quickly in a production setup, following best practices. I code mostly in Python, but I am familiar with Scala too. With regards to data, I am SQL proficient in both pure database stack, as in Python. Data quality, data modeling and data cleansing are in the center whenever I work with data.</p>



<p>When I speak of data platforms, my experience is in E2E data pipeline design, architecture, development and operations, following (in most cases) Inmon&#8217;s architecture and Kimball&#8217;s dimensional approach, on Data Warehouse (DWH) or Data Lakehouse (DLH), centralized or self-service.</p>



<p>When I speak of application development, my experience is in E2E solution design, architecture, development and operations, following (in most cases) normalization techniques and micro-services.</p>



<p>In my free time I like to experiment with technologies, while trying to document (on Medium) how easy is it to get my data as a private consumer.</p>
